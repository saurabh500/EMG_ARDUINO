# EMG_ARDUINO
A software to analyze the EMG data from the EMG sensor via Arduino.

A hackathon involving the prosthetic hand (The raptor hand) was organized by University of Washington Mechanical Engineering department.

The team I was a part of, worked on creating a lock and unlock mechanism for the Raptor hand. The lock mechanism involved mechanical devices. The unlock mechanism consisted of EMG analysis of the forearm muscles.

This is the Arduino code for the analysis of the EMG signals.
